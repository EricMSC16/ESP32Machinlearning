This repository contains examples of how we can implement machine learning algorithms using python-sklearn, and then how to pass them to a microcontroller.
These examples are following in series of videos attached: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRQMKp7B0MU&ab_channel=moisesstevendmezarodriguez

Edge computing: It includes python code.
mpu9250_dtree_porter1 and mpu9250_ml1: arduino code and implementing sklearn porter.
